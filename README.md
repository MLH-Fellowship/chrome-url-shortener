## Frontend Project Setup(klinurl_frontend folder): 
- To install project dependencies(jest) run:
```
npm install
```
- To test if it works, visit ```chrome://extensions``` in your browser and ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.

- Click Load unpacked extension and select the directory in which your extension files live(basically, this project's folder). If the extension is valid, it will be active straight away so you can click on the extension's icon in your browser's address bar; this action should trigger a display of a pop up icon.

## Backend Project Setup(klinurl_api folder): 

* clone project to your local machine
* navigate to the project's root directory
* Then create a virtual environemnt and install all the project dependencies in the pipfile using the command :

```
pipenv install

```
If the command above throws an error, then you most likely do not have pipenv installed. In that case use the command below to install pipenv.

```
pip install pipenv

```

Upon completion run the first command again
